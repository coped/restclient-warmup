# Command-line Bing Search

### About
Overstimulated by the Bing search page? By using the `rest-client` gem, this program takes in your search query and spits back the raw html of the search results page for your viewing pleasure, all from the command-line!

### How To Use
Run 
```
ruby search.rb
``` 
from this program's root directory and enter your search query when prompted.
